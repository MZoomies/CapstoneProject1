    <p>
      I am a Chemical Engineer graduated in 2019. I am a laboratory technician
      working with asbestos's analysis. I am currently motivated to switch areas
      from chemical to programming, trying to learn on my own how to be a web
      developer.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Eurofins Lab Environment Testing Portugal, April 2021 -- Present
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sample analysis of diferente materials in order to determine the
            presence of asbestos.
          </li>
          <li>
            Observation of fibers under polarized light optical microscope.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        SprayCork, 2019 -- 2021
        <ul>
          <li>
            The work is part of an I\&D project promoted by Amorim Cork
            Composites.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimization of the best polymer to work as a binder to agglomerate
            the cork particles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Protection of the cork particles from the UV light in order to avoid
            the colour changes of the coating (cork tends to get lighter with
            sun exposure).
          </li>
          <li>
            Development of formulations compatible with spray application.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            Master thesis developed at Laboratory for Process Engineering,

          <li>
            Microencapsulation of antioxidants by double emulsion with solvent
            evaporation technique.
          </li>
          <li>
            The resulting microparticles were characterized in terms of size
            (laser granulometry), morphology (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and
            total phenolic content (Folin-Ciocalteu method).
